# Crime AlertðŸš¨

Crime Alert is a Crime Prevention and Analysis website intended to have a deeper understanding of crimes that are occurring in our country.

In this website we have included different states of India where we have given the emergency numbers like police control room, woman helpline and many other emergencies contact numbers of different areas in that state. This will help the person to get help in a short time. Along with this we have also included tables which shows the different types of crimes that are taking place and the number of that crime over the years in our Country. This will help the users to stay up to date and have knowledge about the crimes so that they can stay safe.


This model includes various features like:
